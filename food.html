          <p class="pt-3 ">Dal Baati is the most famous dish of Rajasthan. Almost everyone is aware of this dish due to its popularity. The crispy batis that gets cooked over a fire is the best thing to have dinner. Whenever you order a traditional Rajasthani Food thali, they will have this dish for sure. The name itself suggests the three parts of the meal. They make the dal with five different types of dals and several spices. The sweet churma gets made using the leftover dish from the bati. The churma was my favourite part as it just melts in your mouth. The whole dish is often made with ghee which enhances the flavour and smell.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center text-success">Kashmiri Food</h1>
        <p>Kashmiri food originated from the picturesque Kashmir Valley, the crown of India that lies in the lap of the Himalayas. Kashmir not only offers mesmerising locations but also a wide range of lip smacking and exotic delicacies. Traditionally rice has remained the staple food for the Kashmir populace which is most popularly complimented with varied preparations of meat. Kashmiris including the Brahmin Pandits are voracious meat eaters and thus a number of appetizing and luscious Kashmiri dishes of meat like rogan josh and yakhni are available. Varied range of traditional Kashmiri breads like bakarkhani and tea like sheer chai are also quite popular in the region.</p>
